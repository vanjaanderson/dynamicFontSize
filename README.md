Dynamic Font Size
=================

This is a small DOM scripting example I did for a project on sizing the font on a business card.

The code is not unobtrusive, style is performed in JavaScript code. 

####ToDo
* Implement AJAX to update values in form.
* Add event listener to change values when submitting the form.

####Changelog
* First commit 206-08-04
